# Switch Ruby Workflow for Alfred App

A simple Ruby development workflow for Mavericks to switch system Ruby between 2.0.0 and 1.8.7.

My use case is specifically for Alfred workflows development, since Alfred uses the system Ruby, and not the binaries from RVM or rbenv. It might come handy in similar situations where system Ruby is needed.

## Usage

Type the ```switchruby``` keyword to see the menu option:
![switch ruby](https://raw.github.com/ramiroaraujo/alfred-switch-system-ruby-workflow/master/screenshots/switch-ruby.png)

The only actionable option is the first, which will switch between Ruby 2.0.0 and Ruby 1.8.7. The workflow will ask por Administration Privileges to continue.

## Installation
Download the [alfred-switch-ruby.alfredworkflow](https://github.com/ramiroaraujo/alfred-switch-ruby-workflow/raw/master/alfred-switch-system-ruby.alfredworkflow) and import to Alfred 2.
